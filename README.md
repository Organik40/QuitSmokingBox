```

### Step-by-Step Assembly

1. **Prepare the ESP32-S3 Nano**
   - Connect USB cable for programming
   - Verify board selection in PlatformIO

2. **Connect OLED Display**
   - Wire I2C connections (SDA, SCL)
   - Connect power (3.3V, GND)
   - Test display initialization

3. **Install Servo Motor**
   - Mount servo in the box mechanism
   - Connect signal wire to GPIO 18
   - Use external power supply for reliable operation

4. **Add Emergency Button**
   - Install button inside the box
   - Wire between GPIO 19 and GND
   - Add pull-up resistor if needed

5. **3D Print Enclosure**
