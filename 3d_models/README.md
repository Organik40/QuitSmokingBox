# 3D Models - Coming Soon! 🏗️

This directory will contain the STL files for the Quit Smoking Timer Box enclosure once they are completed.

## Current Status: 🚧 In Development

The 3D models are currently being designed and are not yet available. The project is fully functional without the enclosure - you can build and test the system using a breadboard setup.

## Planned Models

### Core Enclosure
- **`box_base.stl`** - Main container for electronics
- **`box_lid.stl`** - Servo-controlled access lid
- **`servo_mount.stl`** - Secure mounting for DS3218MG servo
- **`display_mount.stl`** - Frame for OLED display

### Design Goals
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Easy assembly
- ✅ Secure servo mounting
- ✅ Accessible ports for charging/programming
- ✅ Tamper resistance
- ✅ Clean cable management

## Development Timeline

**Phase 1: Design** 🎨 *In Progress*
- CAD modeling of all components
- Servo mechanism optimization
- Display integration planning

**Phase 2: Prototyping** 🔧 *Coming Next*
- Test prints and iterations
- Fit and finish testing
- Assembly documentation

**Phase 3: Release** 🚀 *Coming Soon*
- Final STL files
- Print settings documentation
- Assembly guide with photos

## Temporary Setup

While waiting for the 3D models, you can prototype with:
- Breadboard for electronics
- Temporary servo mounting (zip ties, brackets)
- Open-air testing setup

The firmware and web interface are fully functional without the enclosure!
